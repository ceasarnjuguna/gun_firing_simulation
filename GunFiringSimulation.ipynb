        "a) Newtonian Physics: The model assumes Newtonian physics applies, which is a reasonable assumption for bullet trajectories at non-relativistic speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "b) Air Resistance: The model assumes that air resistance acts on the bullet. This is modelled as being proportional to the velocity of the bullet, which is a simplification. In reality, air resistance is a complex function of the speed, shape, and spin of the bullet, as well as atmospheric conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "c) Constant Wind Speed: The model takes a constant wind speed as input. In reality, wind speed can vary greatly over the trajectory of a bullet, both in magnitude and direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "d) Gravity: The model assumes a constant gravitational acceleration. In reality, the force of gravity decreases slightly as the distance from the Earth's center increases, but this effect is negligible for the ranges at which bullets are typically fired.\n",
        "\n",
        "e) Flat Earth: The model does not take into account the curvature of the Earth. For most practical purposes, this is an acceptable simplification, but for long-range ballistics, the Coriolis effect due to the rotation of the Earth can become significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "f) No Bullet Spin: The model doesn't account for the gyroscopic effects caused by the spin of the bullet (rifling), which can stabilize the bullet and affect its trajectory.\n",
        "\n",
        "g) Initial Conditions: The model assumes the initial position, velocity, and angle of the bullet are known and fixed.\n"
